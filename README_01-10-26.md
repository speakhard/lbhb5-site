# Last Best Hope — Podsite Instance

This repository contains the **source content and generated site** for  
**LAST BEST HOPE**, a Babylon 5 podcast.

This site is built using **Podsite**, a local static-site generator + editor.
All builds happen **locally**. The generated HTML in `dist/` is committed
directly to GitHub and served by Cloudflare Pages with **no remote build step**.

---

## The one thing you usually do

1. In Finder, open:
   ```
   podsite-engine/launchers/
   ```
2. Double-click **Podsite.command**
3. Your browser opens to:
   ```
   http://127.0.0.1:5544/
   ```
4. Edit episodes and transcripts
5. Click **Publish**

---

## How publishing works

Publishing performs:

1. Local build
2. `git add -A`
3. `git commit`
4. `git push`

The `dist/` folder is committed and deployed directly.

## Folder layout

```
lbh-podsite/
├── dist/                  # Final website (committed)
├── episodes_meta/
├── raw_transcripts/
├── processed_transcripts/
├── transcripts/
├── static/
├── templates_overrides/
└── podsite.yaml
```

---

## Editing content

Use the browser editor to:
- edit episode metadata
- upload transcripts
- clean transcripts
- embed Bluesky posts
- add links

Metadata lives in `episodes_meta/`.

---

## Design changes

Edit:
- `templates/*.html`
- `static/site.css`

Then **Build → Publish**.

---

## Deployment

Cloudflare Pages:
- does not run a build
- serves `dist/` directly

No CI. No Python on the server.

---

## Philosophy

Static, local, boring, durable.
